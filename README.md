1.	Passenger 
•	Local Passenger
•	foreign passenger
2.	Inspector
3.	Bus Conductor
4.	Manager 

Distribution of the Workflow
•	Passenger:   Passenger can be Local passengers or Foreigners. Each passenger will receive a unique digital token, which they must display to a digital reader both when they board the bus and when it reaches at its destination. Passengers who get tokens will maintain an account with public transportation providers. By going to the website of the supplier of the transportation service, users will be able to add credit online. For certain passengers to get their expenditures back from their employers, it may be important for them to be able to check up the trips they have done and the tickets they have paid. 

•	Inspector: Inspector can view check if anyone traveling without a valid ticket

•	Bus Conductor:   Bus conductor check the passenger’s credit validity like Insufficient Credit and, he is the person who collect the physical credits

•	Manager: Public transport manger is the person who need to have information on how many people use different parts of the network at different times of day and on different days of the week to plan schedules or to identify possible overcrowding on parts of the network. And they will require details on the fares received from passengers and how they relate to previously taken voyages to arrange the finances. They could also want to know how frequently the ticket inspectors find passengers without valid tickets, as this information could determine whether more inspectors are needed
